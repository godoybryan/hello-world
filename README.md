# hello-world
=================
I am a CG animator that also dabbles in Python (mostly to build animation tools in Maya).
I love all areas of animated filmmaking, especially the more technical stuff so here I am writting scripts to not only speed up my work but hopefully also the work of others too.

If anyone wants to follow me, here are a few places. I'll make sure to follow back if you send me a shout.
