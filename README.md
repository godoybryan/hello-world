# hello-world
=================
I am a CG animator that also dabbles in Python (mostly to build animation tools in Maya).
I love all areas of animated filmmaking, especially the more technical stuff.
I enjoy writting scripts not only to help speed up my work but also to stay sharp and grow as a technical artist.

If anyone wants to follow me, here are a few places. I'll make sure to follow back if you send me a shout.
